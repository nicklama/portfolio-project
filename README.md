# Nicholas Lamattina's Web Portfolio

## Introduction

This project is designed to be the central hub to showcase what I have learnt throughout my 3 month \_nology course and also provide visitors with an insight into who I am. It contains links and descriptions for all of the other projects I have built and the various tech stacks I have been exposed to.

## Goals

The aim of this project was to apply my new HTML and SCSS skills to create a simple and informative portfolio website. The site was to be created with many screen-sizes in mind, including mobile.

## Requirements

The portfolio must utilise SCSS for styling, B.E.M naming convention and added responsiveness for all screen sizes.

### MVP

-   [x] A home section with my name and title
-   [x] An about section with a little intro to myself
-   [x] A tech stacks/skills section with all the languages I have learned during the course
-   [x] A project section where each project has a description, link to a live version and link to the matching GitHub Repo
-   [x] A contact section with my email, GitHub and LinkedIn profile links

## Implementation

I started by choosing a simple and clean colour palette from Coolors to be the theme for my website. Then I built the general layout of the page with separate sections for each area as per the MVP. I struggled with ensuring that the navbar would take up the full width of the page but after researching this, I was able to style it as I desired.

Initially, I had all my projects listed in one row but I decided to revamp the section to put more emphasis on each project and also allow for extra content to be easily added to it later on. Lastly, I implemented media queries to ensure that my portfolio was responsive, looked good on all device sizes and contained no overlapping content.

## Future of the Project

Given more time, I would like to add animations/effects to the portfolio such as an interactive background and projects section to make them stand out more. I will continue to update my website as I complete more projects during my \_nology course and beyond to ensure it is an up-to-date hub for visitors to see.
