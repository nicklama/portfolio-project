                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a mathematics graduate with a real passion for applying my analytical lens
                    to solve problems in meaningful contexts. I was first exposed to programming
                    while studying. I enjoyed utilising my mathematical expertise to create
                    functions and algorithms in MATLAB. After graduating I worked in customer
                    service then later as an Accounts Receivable Team Leader but I always desired to
                    get back to exploring my love of tech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up my dad would always have the latest gadgets which is where my keen
                    interest in tech started. Later I got into building custom computers as I really
                    enjoyed seeing how all the parts worked together in unison. After working in
                    accounting for 6 months, I decided to look for a change and discovered _nology.
                    The _nology training program appealed to me as it appeared to be very structured
                    and offered up-to-date skills for the current tech market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I enjoy going to the movies, playing video games, tennis and
                    collecting hip-hop vinyls. I like PC gaming because if something is not
                    functioning correctly, often you can research the problem online and solve it
                    yourself for the best experience possible. I am also currently learning Italian
                    as I hope to visit to my grandparent's hometown someday soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studying at _nology as a Junior Software Engineer is providing me with the
                    skills and experience to be a well-rounded and versatile programmer. With these
                    new skills, I aim to work for a company that has a positive impact in today's
                    society.
